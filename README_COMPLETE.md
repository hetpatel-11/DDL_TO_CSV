# Complete Fake Data Generation System

A comprehensive Python system that generates logical and consistent fake data for college/university systems. This system creates three interconnected datasets that maintain realistic relationships and avoid the common pitfalls of AI-generated fake data.

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

You mentioned that one of the biggest challenges when prompting ChatGPT to create fake data is that it doesn't understand relationships in the data and may generate illogical or inconsistent information. This system solves that problem by implementing **intelligent data generation with logical consistency across multiple related datasets**.

## 📊 **Datasets Generated**

### 1. **Prospect Data** (`fake_prospect_data.csv`)
- **Purpose**: College prospect tracking and inquiry management
- **Records**: 150 prospect records
- **Key Features**: Cultural consistency, logical source relationships, appropriate birthdates

### 2. **Admission Data** (`fake_admission_data.csv`)
- **Purpose**: College admission application tracking
- **Records**: 38 admission records
- **Key Features**: Realistic application timelines, college-major consistency, proper status progression

### 3. **Student Data** (`fake_student_data.csv`)
- **Purpose**: Student registration tracking
- **Records**: 14 student records
- **Key Features**: Links to admitted students, realistic registration dates

## 🔗 **Data Relationships**

The system maintains logical relationships between datasets:

```
Prospect Data → Admission Data → Student Data
     ↓              ↓              ↓
  Inquiries → Applications → Registrations
```

- **Prospect → Admission**: Some prospects become applicants
- **Admission → Student**: Admitted students can register
- **Cross-dataset consistency**: Applicant IDs, academic terms, dates

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Generate All Data at Once**
```bash
python3 generate_all_fake_data.py
```

This will generate all three datasets in the correct sequence and validate them automatically.

### **Generate Individual Datasets**
```bash
# Generate prospect data only
python3 fake_prospect_data_generator.py

# Generate admission data only
python3 fake_admission_data_generator.py

# Generate student data only
python3 fake_student_data_generator.py
```

### **Validate Data**
```bash
# Validate all datasets and their relationships
python3 validate_all_data.py

# Validate individual datasets
python3 validate_data.py
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Data Generation Logic**

#### **Prospect Data**
```python
# Cultural pattern matching
def determine_culture_from_name(self, first_name: str, last_name: str) -> str:
    name_lower = f"{first_name} {last_name}".lower()
    if any(pattern in name_lower for pattern in indian_patterns):
        return 'indian'
    # ... more cultures

# Source relationship mapping
source_relationships = {
    'college board': ['college board', 'email', 'campus visit'],
    'high school visit': ['college board', 'campus visit', 'college fair'],
    # ... more relationships
}
```

#### **Admission Data**
```python
# Application timeline logic
def generate_dates(self, app_type: str) -> Tuple[str, str, str, str]:
    # Application date within appropriate range
    app_date_range = self.application_date_ranges[app_type]
    # Decision date after application
    decision_range = self.decision_date_ranges[app_type]
    # Deposit date after admission
    deposit_range = self.deposit_date_ranges[app_type]
```

#### **Student Data**
```python
# Links to admission data
def load_admission_data(self):
    with open('fake_admission_data.csv', 'r') as file:
        for row in reader:
            self.admission_applicants.add(row['applicant'])
```

from fake_student_data_generator import StudentDataGenerator

# Generate custom datasets
prospect_gen = ProspectDataGenerator()
prospect_records = prospect_gen.generate_dataset(500)

admission_gen = AdmissionDataGenerator()
admission_records = admission_gen.generate_dataset(100)

student_gen = StudentDataGenerator()
student_records = student_gen.generate_dataset(50)
